This app lets you submit a photo of food and returns the predicted food category. 🍕

The model was developed using the [food-101 dataset](https://www.vision.ee.ethz.ch/datasets_extra/food-101/) and the [fastai](https://github.com/fastai/fastai) deep learning library, which is built on PyTorch.

To learn more about deep learning, consider taking the [fast.ai course](https://www.fast.ai/) taught by [Jeremy Howard](https://www.fast.ai/about/#jeremy) and [Rachel Thomas](https://www.fast.ai/about/#rachel).
